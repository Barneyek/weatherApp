# About app

The application allows you to view the past (5 days) weather, present and future (2 days) weather for the location or city selected by the user.


In the main view, the user can select a location or city and see the weather for it (at least the temperature, whether it is sunny, rainfall).

The user can create an account (by e-mail / login and password). After logging in, the user has an additional view where he can select and save his favorite city.
